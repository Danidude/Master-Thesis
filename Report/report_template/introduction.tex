\section{Introduction}

Every year people die from accidents on board ships, and as good as the evacuation plans may be now, 
they will need improvement to ensure that as many passengers as possible survives. This project will work
 on modifying existing algorithms that will find the safest path from A to B during a crisis, and which could
 one day be used to help save lives during a crisis that otherwise may have been lost. 

Our main focus will be on the Ant Colony Optimization, a pathfinding algorithm which finds a path through
 the environment to the desired destination by mimicking the behavior of an ant colony. It does so by sending 
out ants that run randomly around until they find the destination and report back on the path they took.
 This path will be marked with pheromones and any other ant is more likely to walk the same path as the successful ant. 

In this thesis we will compare Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm to ACO, as Dijkstra's is one of the most commonly
 used pathfinding algorithms today. We will model the ship as a dynamic graph with nodes and vertices where
 the nodes can be rooms, hallways or other sections of the ships and the vertices indicate that it is possible to
 transition from one node to another. Additionally, we will simulate human behavior during a crisis and observe
 how this affects the algorithms. Finally we will look into how high occupant density around exits slow down the 
evacuation process and how to redirect passengers if needed.

\section{Motivation}

Every year people die in boating accidents, we hope that our work can be
used to save future lives. Jim Hall, the Chairman of the National Transportation 
Safety Board testified in front of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime 
Transportation, making several safety recomendations after the Scandinavian Star
accident \cite{ntsb}. One of them were to "Improve crew language/communication 
ability to assist passengers during emergencies." Our work, which will be part of a system
that will provide passengers with the quickest route to the exit, could output 
any directions in the language of the phone owner. This would not only improve 
communication if the employees and passengers do not speak the same language, 
it would also ensure that the directives reach all passengers quicker than if the employees 
were to guide all passengers. Additionally it increases the probability that all passengers 
receives proper guidance. For instance any message played over a sound system could be
difficult to hear during a panic and passengers could be in rooms or corridors
where they would be unrachable for the employees.

\section{Problem Statement}

Our goal is to evaluate several algorithms and determine which algorithm will provide us with the
best route between two points in dynamic graphs with nodes and vertices. Our hypothesis
is that Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) will perform better than conventional pathfinding
algorithms. Performance is measured by how many passengers survive the crisis situation
and how efficient the algorithms are. 

Secondly, we hypothesize that ACO will outperform djikstra's pathfinding algorithm
given a continuously changing graph. In a real crisis situation the environment is subject
to change. For instance a corridor that previously was safe can be filled with smoke
or a room that was empty can become filled with people and be undesirable as a path
to the exit.

Thirdly, we hypothesize that ACO will achieve a better outcome than djikstra's pathfinding algorithm
given high occupant density around exits. High occupant density is dangerous not only
because it will slow the evacuation speed it also creates potentially harmful situations. Thus the algorithm
should predict possible future bottlenecks and redirect passengers as needed.

Finally, we hypothesize that ACO will produce better results than djikstra's pathfinding algorithm
by adding human behavior. To produce accurate results the algorithms needs to be subjected
to a model that is as close to reality as possible and it then becomes necessary to include
human behavior to the model. Passengers can ignore directions, misunderstand directions, panic
and so forth. Behavior is different if the passenger is alone, with his or her family, or in a large group;
and thus it becomes important to account for individuals that may not follow the directions perfectly.

\section{Limitations and key assumptions}

To properly define the scope of our master thesis we have outlined
some limitations and assumptions. We will limit ourselves to testing and modifying algorithms;
we will not create completely new algorithms, a fully fleshed out system that would distribute the
safest paths to the passenger nor will we be creating the application that would run on the passenger's smartphones.
The focus in our master thesis will be on the algorithms themselves and not the final system as that have a large set
of challenges itself. For instance the complete system would need to find ways to distribute directions to each phone,
discover which phones are within the crisis area, receive information about the location of the fire onboard the ship etc.

We will apply current knowledge of human behavior during crisis. The field of human behavior during a crisis is large
and expanding it would be outside of our field of expertise. And as such we will use existing models and knowledge
to simulate the demeanor of the passengers. Additionally we assume that human behavior can be realistically modeled
and that such a framework can capture the complexity of passengers in a crisis.

A high occupant density around exists will quickly slow down evacuation speed and as such there have been conducted several studies
towards investigating the dynamics around evacuations. As these studies have yielded promising results we will
limit ourselves to using these results and not producing our own. We do not find it necessary to focus on this particular segment 
of the evacuation process as we wish to have a broader view of the entire evacuation development.

We assume a ship with hazards can be sufficiently modeled as a graph with nodes and vertices. As a ship is a very complex
environment it is possible that by reducing a complex structure into a simpler model some details would be lost in the
translation. For instance a table could be knocked over or a spill could cause someone to slip. However, as there are a large number of 
passengers on large ships we expect that by simply adding some regulatory factors to each area in the ship and running
several iterations the results will be fairly realistic.

\section{Contributions}

 We will make improvements to already existing pathfinding algorithms that can be used to find a path 
for passengers evacuating a ship. Given that our hypothesis is proven
correct our then modified version of ACO will outperform conventional pathfinding algorithms in our 
specific scenario. This in turn could have wider applications as there are multiple scenarios
where finding a path is subject to change. 

We will determine how human behaviour and occupant density around exits affects path finding algorithms.
It is easy to imagine how a panic around an evacuation bottleneck will become dangerous and slow
down the rate of egress even further than it normaly would. We will attempt to find ways to redirect
evacuees before the issue occurs or, failing that, we will calculate the optimal way to solve the problem.

\section{Target audience}


\section{Report outline / Thesis Organization}

The master thesis will contain 4 chapters: Introduction, Methods, Results and Conclusion.
The introduction will start by broadly describing the thesis in simple terms, then explain the motivation behind the project,
the goal of the thesis, the current state of the art and finally the problem statement. 

The Methods chapter will describe the methods we have used in our research, why we used them and what makes
our research different from the current state of the art. It will describe the implementation of the human behavior,
the calculations regarding the evacuation speed and egress restricting factors as well as the implementation of the 
ship model. Furthermore, the methods chapter will contain the hypothesis.

The Results chapter will present the results and the evidence that either supports or oppose our hypothesis. The
statistical data gathered using the methods in the previous chapter will be displayed and any issues we will have had
will be explained.

The Discussion will look at what the data means, whether it matters or not and how it compares to other research in the field.
Additionally it will discuss how successful the project has been and if ACO is better than conventional algorithms, as we hypothesized.
Finally it will contain proposed future steps that can be made to continue developing the project.
