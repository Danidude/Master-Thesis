\section{Ant colony optimization versus Dijkstra}
In the testing the simulation was repeated from 200 to 500 times, as the results stayed the same when increasing it and therefore was no point in spending more time on the same results. The number of passengers was set to the ship maximum number of passengers stated on (website needed: http://www.cruisedeckplans.com/).


\subsection{Dead ships}

In a dead ship scenario, no electronics on board the ship is working as the power is out. Therefore the algorithms can not get any information about dangerous zones aboard the ship. So in this case it is best to find the fastest way for the passengers to get to the life boats.
